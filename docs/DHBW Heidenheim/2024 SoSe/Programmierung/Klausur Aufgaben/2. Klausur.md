### Task 1: Classes and Inheritance

Create a base class `Shape` with a method `CalculateArea()` and an abstract method `DisplayInfo()`. Then, create three derived classes `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`. Each derived class should override `CalculateArea()` to compute the area and implement `DisplayInfo()` to print information about the shape. Use these classes in a program that processes an array of shapes and prints their areas and info.

### Task 2: Polymorphism and Interfaces

Design an interface `IDisplayable` with a method `Display()`. Implement this interface in a `Book` class and a `Movie` class, each having properties like `Title`, `Year`, and a custom `Display()` method. Then, create a list of `IDisplayable` items that can contain both `Book` and `Movie` objects, and iterate through this list, calling `Display()` on each item.

### Task 3: Collections and Generics

Write a generic class `Cache<T>` that can store a set of key-value pairs. It should have methods `AddItem(T key, T value)`, `RemoveItem(T key)`, and `GetItem(T key)`. Then, write a program that uses this class to store and retrieve values of different data types (e.g., strings, integers).

### Task 4: Exception Handling

Create a method `DivideNumbers(int a, int b)` that takes two integers and returns their division. Implement proper exception handling to catch `DivideByZeroException` and `FormatException`. Additionally, create a custom exception `InvalidNumberException` that is thrown when negative numbers are passed as input.

### Task 5: Iterator

Implement an iterator for a class `FibonacciSequence` that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The class should implement `IEnumerable<int>` and allow iteration using a `foreach` loop.

### Task 6: Operator Overloading

Create a `ComplexNumber` class to represent complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts). Overload the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.
